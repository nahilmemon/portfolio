    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">About Me</h1>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      I’m a creative technologist and educator who thrives at the intersection of storytelling, technology, and play. I build experiences that spark curiosity, invite exploration, and leave a little room for wonder.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      My path has never been straight. I started in Civil Engineering and Visual Arts at NYU Abu Dhabi, ventured into front-end web development, and discovered my spark in education. Along the way, I’ve worked as a web developer, instructional designer, animator, and creative director. Each twist has shaped how I approach my work: with curiosity, creativity, and a human-centered lens.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      I’ve taught students from elementary school through college to bring ideas to life using tools like Scratch, Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Unity, Arduino, and FlutterFlow. I’ve also designed curricula for web development, mobile app design, and digital animation—always with an eye toward hands-on, story-driven learning. Outside the classroom, I’ve created interactive installations, web tools, and multimedia experiences, from paintings that respond to wind to robots performing theatrical plays.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg mb-4">
      I’m drawn to the in-between spaces—where code meets narrative, science meets storytelling, and education meets playful interactivity. Whether teaching, building, designing, or mentoring, I aim to create moments that feel just a little magical.
